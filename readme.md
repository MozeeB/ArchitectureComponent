### TIPS 

#### 1
        Android supports RTL layouts from API 17+ i.e., Android 4.2 (Jelly Bean).and when we make our layout
        to support both RTL and LTR then we can not use layout_marginleft and layout_marginRight there
        we use layout_marginstart and layout_maginend.
        
#### 2
     xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" 
      
 In XML, *xmlns* declares a *Namespace*. In fact, **The namespace has pretty much the same uses as the package name in a Java application.**  

#### 3

    When a dimension is set to MATCH_CONSTRAINT, the default behavior is to have the resulting size take all the available space.
